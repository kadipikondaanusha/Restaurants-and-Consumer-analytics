# Restaurant and Consumer Analytics Project

## Overview
The Restaurant and Consumer Analytics project focuses on analyzing dining experiences, customer preferences, and restaurant performance. It simulates a restaurant recommendation and analysis system using interconnected entities such as consumers, restaurants, cuisines, and ratings. The project provides hands-on experience in building a structured SQL database and exploring relationships between real-world datasets.

## Purpose
The main goal is to enhance decision-making, improve customer satisfaction, and promote data-driven strategies in the food and hospitality industry. Efficient data management helps businesses understand consumer behavior, cuisine popularity, and service quality across different locations.

## Features
- Structured SQL database design simulating a restaurant recommendation system
- Analysis of consumer preferences, order patterns, and restaurant performance
- SQL query examples for extracting meaningful insights, such as:
  - Identifying consumer demographics with specific traits (e.g., students who are smokers)
  - Querying restaurant franchise locations and ratings
  - Calculating average ratings and comparing with overall averages
  - Categorizing consumers by engagement scores
  - Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Views for advanced queries
  - Stored procedures to fetch restaurant ratings above a threshold
- Focus on real-world data relationships involving consumers, restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and online orders

## Sample SQL Queries
- Find consumers who are students and smokers
- List names and cities of franchise restaurants
- Calculate average overall ratings for restaurants in a specific city
- Count restaurant ratings by students exceeding a threshold
- Find consumers who rated restaurants but avoided certain cuisines
- Rank restaurant ratings using CTEs for detailed insights

## Installation & Usage
This project is designed to be implemented using a relational database system like MySQL. Steps to use the project:
1. Create the database schema with tables for consumers, restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and orders
2. Populate the tables with sample or real data
3. Execute the provided SQL queries to analyze data and generate reports
4. Modify or extend queries as needed to address specific business questions or analytics goals
